# Solutions to The Go Programming Language
# by Alan A.A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan (solutions by Lachlan Marnham)
I like to solve textbook problems for fun. I am providing them for public consumption under the assumption that they will be 
used by people to complement self-study. They are not intended for use by school/university students who were assigned 
problems from the textbook by an instructor. If you are a school/university student who was assigned problems from the 
textbook by an instructor, and have found your way here with a mind to copy my solutions: 1) please don't do that, and 
2) consider asking your instructor to assign their own problems so your peers can't do it either.

 
These will rarely present the optimal solution to the given problem. Instead, I always stick to the paradigm of only using
bits of the language which have been covered to the point in the textbook where the exercise appears. This can be annoying
sometimes, because there is often a very elegant way to solve a problem which I'm forced to avoid because it's covered in a
later chapter. On the other hand, I have found that forcing myself to solve problems in the 'beginner' way from time to time
occasionally prevents me from slipping into the mindset of trying to over-engineer everything in the real world. Also, this is
the only realistic way to publish solutions which can be understood by anybody who is following along with the textbook.
